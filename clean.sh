## What Was Removed

### ✅ Root-Level Legacy Files (Duplicates)
- `bbox_extraction.py` → Available in `app/legacy/`
- `get_depth.py` → Available in `app/legacy/`  
- `dataloader.py` → Available in `app/legacy/`
- `model.py` → Available in `app/legacy/`
- `losses.py` → Available in `app/legacy/`
- `loaders/` → Available in `app/legacy/loaders/`
- `options/` → Available in `app/legacy/options/`
- `util/` → Available in `app/legacy/util/`

### ✅ Unused Detection Services (MediaPipe-Only Setup)
- `app/services/detection_service.py` → Legacy RetinaNet (broken imports)
- `app/services/detection_service_dev.py` → Development fallback (unused)
- `app/services/detection_service_simple.py` → Simple fallback (unused)
- `app/services/depth_service.py` → Legacy depth service (broken imports)  
- `app/services/depth_service_dev.py` → Development fallback (unused)

### ✅ Duplicate Model Files
- `app/models/architectures/` → Duplicate of `app/legacy/models/`
- `app/models/weights/checkpoints/` → Duplicate of main weight file

### ✅ Empty Directories
- `docs/` → Empty documentation directory
- `static/` → Empty static files directory
- `app/data/models/` → Empty data models directory
- `app/data/processors/` → Empty processors directory
- `app/data/validators/` → Empty validators directory

### ✅ Legacy Configuration
- `config/classes.csv` → RetinaNet classes (MediaPipe doesn't need)

### ✅ Backup/Temporary Files
- `app/core/config.py.backup` → Pydantic fix backup
- `test_simple_server.py` → Debug test server
- `requirements.txt.backup` → Old requirements backup

### ✅ Old Docker Files
- `docker-compose.yml` → Old version
- `docker-compose.fastapi.yml` → Replaced by dev/prod versions  
- `Dockerfile` → Old version (keeping `Dockerfile.fastapi`)

## What Was Kept

### ✅ Core FastAPI Application
- `app/main.py` → FastAPI application
- `app/api/` → API routes and interfaces
- `app/core/` → Core business logic
- `app/services/analysis_service.py` → Main analysis orchestrator
- `app/services/measurement_service.py` → Body measurements
- `app/services/mediapipe_detection_service.py` → Production detection

### ✅ Modern Configuration
- `config/app_config.yaml` → Application configuration
- `config/logging_config.yaml` → Logging configuration
- `start_dev.py` → Development server
- `start_prod.py` → Production server
- `STARTUP_GUIDE.md` → Documentation

### ✅ Assets and Models
- `assets/samples/204.jpg` → Test image
- `app/models/weights/best_depth_Ours_Bilinear_inc_3_net_G.pth` → Depth model
- `app/legacy/` → Complete legacy codebase (preserved)

### ✅ Development Tools
- `dev_tools.py` → Development utilities
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` → Development deployment
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` → Production deployment
- `tests/` → Test framework structure

## Current Clean Architecture

```
BodyVision (Clean)
├── FastAPI Application (app/)
├── MediaPipe Detection (production-ready)

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **🎯 Focused Architecture**: No confusing duplicate files
2. **🚀 Faster Development**: Clear file structure
3. **🧹 Cleaner Imports**: No import conflicts
4. **📦 Smaller Deployment**: Reduced docker image size
5. **🔧 Easier Maintenance**: Clear separation of concerns

Your BodyVision is now clean, modern, and production-ready!
